# Task-2
This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Using the Mall Customer Dataset, we analyze customer behavior using features like Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

The Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters. K-Means is then applied to group similar customers, helping businesses identify high-value customers, budget shoppers, and other segments.

The project includes data preprocessing, clustering implementation, and visualization of the segmented groups. It is built using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn.

This segmentation can assist in personalized marketing and better decision-making in retail strategy.
